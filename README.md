## Survey

Hi there! We are trying to collect feedback from Cypress users who need component testing. Answer a few questions [in this survey](https://forms.gle/qiX2ScqPNEMgwvfA9) about component testing to help us üôè

## TLDR

- What is this? This package allows you to use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) test runner to unit test your React components with zero effort. Here is a typical component testing, notice there is not external URL shown, since it is mounting the component directly.

![Example component test](images/dynamic.gif)

- How is this different from [Enzyme](https://github.com/airbnb/enzyme) or [RTL](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)? It is similar in functionality BUT runs the component in the real browser with full power of Cypress E2E test runner: [live GUI, full API, screen recording, CI support, cross-platform](https://www.cypress.io/features/), and [visual testing](https://on.cypress.io/visual-testing). Ohh, and the code coverage is built-in!
- If you like using `@testing-library/react`, you can use `@testing-library/cypress` for the same `findBy`, `queryBy` commands, see one of the examples in the list below

## Known problems

See issues labeled [v4](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test/labels/v4)

## Install

Requires [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 8 or above.

```sh
npm install --save-dev cypress cypress-react-unit-test
```

## Init

You can use our command line wizard to give you instructions on configuring this plugin. It will try to determine which framework or bundling tool you are using and give you instructions on right configuration.

```sh
cypress-react-unit-test init
```

Or continue with manual installation:

1. Include this plugin from your project's `cypress/support/index.js`

```js
require('cypress-react-unit-test/support')
```

2. Tell Cypress how your React application is transpiled or bundled (using Webpack), so Cypress can load your components. For example, if you use `react-scripts` (even after ejecting) do:

```js
// cypress/plugins/index.js
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  require('cypress-react-unit-test/plugins/react-scripts')(on, config)
  // IMPORTANT to return the config object
  // with the any changed environment variables
  return config
}
```

See [Recipes](./docs/recipes.md) for more examples.

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Turn the experimental component support on in your `cypress.json`. You can also specify where component spec files are located. For example, to have them located in `src` folder use:

```json
{
  "experimentalComponentTesting": true,
  "componentFolder": "src"
}
```

## API

- `mount` is the most important function, allows to mount a given React component as a mini web application and interact with it using Cypress commands
- `createMount` factory function that creates new `mount` function with default options
- `unmount` removes previously mounted component, mostly useful to test how the component cleans up after itself
- `mountHook` mounts a given React Hook in a test component for full testing, see the [`hooks` example](cypress/component/advanced/hooks)

## Examples

```js
import React from 'react'
import { mount } from 'cypress-react-unit-test'
import { HelloWorld } from './hello-world.jsx'
describe('HelloWorld component', () => {
  it('works', () => {
    mount(<HelloWorld />)
    // now use standard Cypress commands
    cy.contains('Hello World!').should('be.visible')
  })
})
```

Using Cypress + cypress-react-unit-test your tests can mock everything:

- method calls via [cy.stub](https://on.cypress.io/stub), see example [mock-fetch](cypress/component/advanced/mock-fetch). Works for both your application code and for [browser API methods](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/stub-navigator-api/)
- network calls via [cy.route](https://on.cypress.io/route) and [cy.route2](https://on.cypress.io/route2)
- ES6 imports, see [mocking-imports](cypress/component/advanced/mocking-imports) and [mocking-component](cypress/component/advanced/mocking-component)
- clock and timers using [cy.clock](https://on.cypress.io/clock), see [set-timeout-example](cypress/component/advanced/set-timeout-example) and [react-query-example](https://github.com/bahmutov/react-query-example)

## Options

In most cases, the component already imports its own styles, thus it looks "right" during the test. If you need another CSS, the simplest way is to import it from the spec file:

```js
// src/Footer.spec.js
import './styles/main.css'
import Footer from './Footer'
it('looks right', () => {
  // styles are applied
  mount(<Footer />)
})
```

### Extra styles

You can pass additional styles, css files and external stylesheets to load, see [docs/styles.md](./docs/styles.md) for the full list of options.

```js
const todo = {
  id: '123',
  title: 'Write more tests',
}
mount(<Todo todo={todo} />, {
  stylesheets: [
    'https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bulma/0.7.2/css/bulma.css',
  ],
})
```

<details>
<summary>Additional configuration</summary>
If your React and React DOM libraries are installed in non-standard paths (think monorepo scenario), you can tell this plugin where to find them. In `cypress.json` specify paths like this:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "cypress-react-unit-test": {
      "react": "node_modules/react/umd/react.development.js",
      "react-dom": "node_modules/react-dom/umd/react-dom.development.js"
    }
  }
}
```

</details>

## Code coverage

If you are using [plugins/cra-v3](plugins/cra-v3) it instruments the code on the fly using `babel-plugin-istanbul` and generates report using dependency [cypress-io/code-coverage](https://github.com/cypress-io/code-coverage) (included). If you want to disable code coverage instrumentation and reporting, use `--env coverage=false` or `CYPRESS_coverage=false` or set in your `cypress.json` file

```json
{
  "env": {
    "coverage": false
  }
}
```

## Visual testing

You can use any Cypress [Visual Testing plugin](https://on.cypress.io/plugins#visual-testing) to perform [visual testing](https://on.cypress.io/visual-testing) from the component tests. This repo has several example projects, see [visual-sudoku](examples/visual-sudoku), [visual-testing-with-percy](examples/visual-testing-with-percy), [visual-testing-with-happo](examples/visual-testing-with-happo), and [visual-testing-with-applitools](examples/visual-testing-with-applitools).

For a larger Do-It-Yourself example with an hour long list of explanation videos, see [bahmutov/sudoku](https://github.com/bahmutov/sudoku) repository. I explain how to write visual testing using open source tools in this [blog post](https://glebbahmutov.com/blog/open-source-visual-testing-of-components/), [video talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00BNExlJUU8), and [slides](https://slides.com/bahmutov/i-see-what-is-going-on).

## Common problems

<details id="lazy">
  <summary>React.lazy does not work</summary>

Cypress only servers a single bundle and does not (yet) provide additional bundling. There are several skipped tests in this repo showing the problem. Track [#524](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test/issues/524) for future work.

</details>

<details id="node-sass">
  <summary>Node Sass</summary>

When using Node Sass styles, tell Cypress to use [the system NodeJS](https://on.cypress.io/configuration#Node-version) rather than its bundled version. In `cypress.json` set option:

```json
{
  "nodeVersion": "system"
}
```

Find full example in [sass-and-ts](examples/sass-and-ts) folder.

</details>

<details id="fast-enough">
  <summary>Slower than Jest</summary>

When you use `cypress-X-unit-test` for component testing, you might notice the tests are slower than using Jest to test the same components. Yes, that's true. A test runner could be made _extremely_ fast if it did nothing, just check out the [auchenberg/volkswagen](https://github.com/auchenberg/volkswagen) test runner - it is blazing on CI üòâ. Of course, Jest does do things, just not inside the real browser environment.

Testing using Jest with its jsdom browser is faster than starting the real browser, loading all libraries, mounting the component and then waiting for the component to actually perform its work in response to the test's actions. But do those tests give you a true confidence that the component is working?

Try this test üôà

Spoiler: it fails, [proof](https://codesandbox.io/s/react-testing-library-demo-forked-z7l2o?file=/src/__tests__/components.js).

```js
const mock = jest.fn()
// render a component that does NOT allow any click events
// using pointerEvents: "none" style
const { getByRole } = render(
  <button style={{ pointerEvents: 'none' }} onClick={mock}>
    text
  </button>,
)
// Jest happily clicks
fireEvent.click(getByRole('button'))
expect(mock).not.toBeCalled()
```

Cypress test on the other hand [fails correctly](cypress/component/basic/fails-correctly).

We think that using `cypress-X-unit-test` runs tests as _fast as your application code is_, and often you need to think how to _slow down_ the Cypress Test Runner so it does not run away from the component's code, just see our blog posts dealing with [test flake](https://cypress.io/blog/tag/flake/).

From the developer's perspective I would ask myself: which tests do I _write faster_? What happens when a test fails and I need to debug the failure: which test runner allows me to _debug a failed test quicker_? While I am partial, I have to say, realistic Cypress tests are easier to write and debug.

Finally, when running tests on the continuous integration service, the true test speed up comes from properly configuring [dependencies caching](https://on.cypress.io/caching) and running [tests in parallel](https://on.cypress.io/parallelization) - something we have extensively documented and consider a solved problem.

<details id="speed">
  <summary>Slow bundling</summary>

When you bundle spec file, you are now bundling React, Read DOM and other libraries, which is might be slow. For now, you can disable inline source maps by adding to your Webpack config settings (if available) the following:

```js
const webpackOptions = {
  devtool: false,
}
```

Keep your eye on issue [#156](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test/issues/156) for more information.

</details>

<details id="missing-code-coverage">
  <summary>Missing code coverage</summary>

If you are using your custom Webpack, this plugin might be missing code coverage information because the code was not instrumented. We try to insert the `babel-plugin-istanbul` plugin automatically, but your bundling might not use Babel, or configure it differently, preventing plugin insertion. Please let us know by opening an issue with full reproducible details.

See related issue [#141](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test/issues/141). You can also debug the plugin's behavior by running it with `DEBUG` environment variable, see [#debugging](#debugging) section.

</details>

<details id="gatsby-not-supported">
  <summary>Gatsby.js projects not supported</summary>

Currently, this project cannot find Webpack settings used by Gatsby.js, thus it cannot bundle specs and application code correctly. Keep an eye on [#307](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test/issues/307)

## Chat

We have a chat workspace at [https://component-testing.slack.com/](https://component-testing.slack.com/), you are welcome to [join us](https://join.slack.com/t/component-testing/shared_invite/zt-jhvuum8m-7UMUhVDAYlND3POGVlhkFg).

## Development

See [docs/development.md](./docs/development.md)

## Debugging

You can see verbose logs from this plugin by running with environment variable

```
DEBUG=cypress-react-unit-test
```

Because finding and modifying Webpack settings while running this plugin is done by [find-webpack](https://github.com/bahmutov/find-webpack) module, you might want to enable its debug messages too.

```
DEBUG=cypress-react-unit-test,find-webpack
```

Since some objects might be deeply nested, if you see an object that is printed simply `{ module: { rules: [ [Object] ] }` you can increase the max printed depth

```
DEBUG=cypress-react-unit-test,find-webpack DEBUG_DEPTH=10
```

## Migration guide

### From v3 to v4

The old v3 `main` branch is available as branch [v3](https://github.com/bahmutov/cypress-react-unit-test/tree/v3)

- the `cy.mount` is now simply `import { mount } from 'cypress-react-unit-test'`
- the support file is simply `require('cypress-react-unit-test/support')`
